# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Stage
2014 Harvard Data Science (CS109) Final project

Project by: Scott Kallgren, David Lieb, and Hannah Somhegyi

## About
Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the way we study cancer. Whole-genome, exome, and RNA sequencing are now routinely used in cancer studies. As the acquisition of these large datasets becomes easier, the bottleneck is quickly shifting from data generation to data analysis. How do we synthesize complex genomic data and how can we use this information to better characterize and predict cancer severity? For our final project we were interested in applying data science approaches to cancer biology. Specifically, we aimed to build a model that could predict breast cancer stage using gene expression and mutation data from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) consortium. Our overall goal was to gain more experience working with large genomic datasets and to apply what we learned in CS109 in doing so. There are many experienced scientists and bioinformatics specialists working on similar questions. Thus, we did not expect to improve on their efforts, but rather to gain more experience with data wrangling and explore these kinds of questions using newly learned machine learning approaches.
